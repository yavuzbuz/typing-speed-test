Hey, how is everything going on? Hope you are doing well.
You think the weather is great today?
I am here for my spa appointment. Can you tell me when I could go in?
Do you know how to file the IT returns? If you do, could you please guide me?
Have a great weekend. See you on Monday.
The teacher is absent today, so we have a substitute.
Do you want to be partners for the group project?
The weather forecast is predicting thunderstorms.
I want to make things right and apologize for my actions.
I spend way too much time scrolling on social media.
Sorry, my phone signal is pretty bad right now.
I will screenshare, so I can show you what I am working on.
Is there a tourist information center nearby?
Thanks for buying me a beer. I will get the next round.
I am sorry, but you have been staring at me for an hour. May I help you?
